    <h4>Security Awareness</h4>
    <p class="big">
        Data is an asset and securing it is everyone's job. It is important to know how to protect data and information
    in times of threat and how to identify vulnerabilities in the system. Regardless of their role, every employee in an organization
    must know the general security guidelines and adapt them. Here's what you can do to secure data:
    </p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-10">
        <ul>
            <li>Update your password every 90 days and use combination of letters and numbers.</li>
            <li>Use secure platforms for file transfers.</li>
            <li>Use discretion when typing in passwords if you're not alone.</li>
            <li>Store confidential data and files in secure storage and on authorized cloud platforms only.</li>
            <li>Check access levels on a monthly basis to eliminate threats posed by unwanted access.</li>
            <li>Use caution when opening attachments and do not open if the sender is from unknown origin.</li>
            <li>Use different credentials for banking, social media and work accounts.</li>
            <li>Use only authentic vendor sites and servers to download software or files.</li>
            <li>Always update your computer and laptop to the latest version of the software
                release and apply patches whereever necessary as new versions eliminate
                known vulnerabilities.</li>
        </ul>

        While it seems basic and mostly common sense, these small mistakes can cost a fortune to the business. Please don't:
    </p>
    <div class="row">

            <img src="donts.png" alt="DONT'S">

        <div class="col-sm-10">
            <ul>
                <li>Respond to emails and attachments from unknown sources. If you have opened an unwanted attachment,
                    please inform IT immediately so they analyze the risk.</li>
                <li>Give away confidential passwords and login details to anyone, remember
                    that IT never requests you to send passwords for verification.</li>
                <li>Use public computers for office purpose.
                    Restrict to using only a secure machine provided by the employer.</li>
                <li>Leave sensitive data on your desk,  shred the printouts after use.</li>
                <li>Leave your computer unlocked, lock them down even if it is just for a quick restroom break.</li>
                <li>Install applications from unknown sources, report them to IT if you really
                    need an application and they will help you install the safest version.</li>
                <li>Plug-in personal devices without IT authorization.</li>

        <h4>Report Phishing</h4>
        <p class="big">Phishing is a malicious attempt to obtain your passwords, credentials and other secure information.
        This is mostly done through emails. Beware of:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Emails from unknown people with attachments.</li>
            <li>Emails claiming to come from IT requesting password and usernames but the actual person is not related IT.</li>
            <li>Emails from known senders asking for personal information or claiming to have won $$$ with an attachment asking you to open it.</li>
            <li>Free offers and coupons from unknown emails.</li>
            <li>Tax refund checks - IRS never asks for personal information over email.</li>
            <li>Exclusive access to pre-release versions of software or games.</li>
            
        </ul>
        
        In all of the above mentioned events, please report to IT helpdesk about the sender
        and if possible, attach a screenshot of the email itself. Do not ever open an the attachment from suspicious emails.
        <br/><br/>
        There is another form of phishing called <strong>Vishing</strong>, which is gaining access to personal information
        by prying on vulnerable people through voice calls. Classic examples are someone claiming to call from your Bank and asking for
        SSN and account numbers, other one would be claiming to call from IRS, asking you to pay $$$$ immediately
        towards taxes or the money you owe. Please refrain from answering unknown calls. If it's important, they will leave
        you a voicemail for you to get back.

        <h4>Personal Security</h4>
        <p class="big">Be a good digital neighbor. Things we do online create an impact offline.
        All it takes to create a better digi-world is this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Own your online activity by keeping a tab on privacy settings
                and limit what's being shared to public.</li>
            <li>If you don't do things in real life, do not do it in your online life.
                Do not go poking or bullying other people online just as you won't in your day-to-day life.</li>
            <li>Do not send an email in anger or resentment. Posts can mean more than words since they have no
                audio prompts as in speaking.</li>
            <li>Treat your data as cash, do not reveal your data to anyone like how you wouldn't
                let others know how much $$$ you own.</li>
            <li>Protect your online presence with complex passwords and use two-step authentication whenever possible.
                The more the layers of security, the safer you are.    
            </li>
            <li>Do not share home wifi passwords with visitors. If you have already done so, please reset
                passwords frequently.</li>

                use layers of protection to safeguard against malicious softwares. What can you do?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use biometric authentication and or patterned passwords on mobile devices.</li>
                    <li>Do not share the same passwords across all devices, use unique passwords whenever possible.</li>
                    <li>Disable bluetooth and GPS in public places, do not connect to free wifi hotspots.</li>
                    <li>Delete apps that are no longer needed. Disable access to photos and GPS
                        to apps if not necessary.</li>
                    <li>Share Cloud data cautiously. Are you sharing personal information to public?</li>
                    <li>Mobile devices are like cash thanks to apple pay, samsung pay. Do not lose them!</li>

                <p>Don't let data take a vacation with you! Protect yourself and your data while you're away with
                these simple steps:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Do not post travel plans to social media. Restrict to immediately family only.</li>
                    <li>Do not take work devices with you on international
                        trips unless it is essential since TSA has authority
                        to confiscate devices and ask for credentials to login.</li>
                    <li>Do not use public cafe's or hotel's computers to login to email,
                        this increases the risk of account compromise.</li>
                    <li>Wait until you get back to share trip details. This will
                        make you lesser of a target by thieves.</li>
                    <li>Keep your devices with you all the time, they are safe with you than in the hotel room or lockers.</li>
